### How I created
I was able to create different colour version of the preview product, sorting feature on reviews, filtering feature on reviews, preview of size chart & including awesome transition and animations. This is a single page website. I haven't done many projects using react, so some features may not be implemented in a simple way. Filtering and sorting was somewhat familiar as i used in normal projects using HTML, CSS & JS. To implement the different colour preview i created a json file containing images of all colours and imported into App.jsx. Same idea was used for dynamic prize change with change of size. Language translation was done using the package ```react-i18next```. At first i created two file for each language malayalam and english, it worked with the help of ```i18next-http-backend``` package. It worked without any issue locally. After hosting on gh-page i can't get the desired output" It was just showing the key name for translation and then i merged it into a single containing both malayalam and english translation details.
